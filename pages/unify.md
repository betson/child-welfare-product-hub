# Unify App

## Made by Think of Us

[http://thinkof-us.org/project/unify-app/](http://thinkof-us.org/project/unify-app/ "Product Homepage")

## Description

Think of Us is currently developing an evidence-informed coaching app called Unify, which provides young people with interactive videos, self-coaching activities, and planning tools to help them identify and set personal goals, while also providing a framework to achieve them. Through the platform, users become equipped to face everyday challenges, such as renting an apartment or reconnecting with biological family. The app also connects the young person with advocates and care providers, forming a personal support network. The Santa Clara County Department of Children and Families and the Washington D.C Department of Behavioral Health, have agreed to pilot Unify.

## Impact

Help the thousands of foster youth who age out every year develop crucial life skills that will help them become self-sufficient adults.

## Testimonials

"Unify helped me identify people in this foster child's network that I was able to follow up with when he ended up running away. I was able to verify he was safe, and I knew that he was with someone who could help him cool down and return him to his foster home. If I didn't have Unify I would have probably gone to the police and alienated the child further by forcing him to come back."

"By working with the youth to determine the goals of the case plan, I had a better idea of how to relate to hshe, and he was more invested in actually accomplishing the goals. It was nice to get away from clinical and technical terms like "achieving permanency" as a goal, and more towards personal, attainable goals for her like finishing high school, getting into college, and working in TV."
